    Overview:

        Shader program 'ui':
            Get shader desc: ui_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_vs_color0 = 1
                    ATTR_vs_uv0 = 2
                    ATTR_vs_frame0 = 3
                Uniform block 'vs_window':
                    C struct: vs_window_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_window = 0
            Fragment shader: fs
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader ui = sg_make_shader(ui_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_color0] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_uv0] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_frame0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_window':

        vs_window_t vs_window = {
            .screen_size = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_window, &SG_RANGE(vs_window));
